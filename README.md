# Intro to Cloud Computing
*Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay as you go pricing.* This allows companies to focus on product innovation and development while AWS handles the infrastructure. 

## Why Cloud Computing?
- IT assets as programmatic resources to quickly set up and tear down resources/
- Dynamic access to resources for agility and flexibility in meeting customer needs.
- Pay as you go pricing model.

Modern computing is based on the client-server model.
**Client**: Web browser or desktop application that a user interacts with to make requests to servers.
**Servers**: Services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

## Benefits of Cloud computing

- **Trade upfront expense for variable expense**: Pay only for the computing resources consumed instead of maintaining data centers.
- **No infrastructure managment and expenses**: No need to spend money or time managing physical infrastructure allowing for undivided focus on the product and customers. 
- **Stop guessing capacity**: No need to estimate how much infrastructure is needed before deployment.
- **Scalability with savings**: Using the services with many others allows for AWS to provide lower cost to each service users.
- **Speed, agility and flexibility**: Faster development and deployment of products, saving time and money.
- **Global in minutes**: AWS services availble world-wide allows for deployment globally within minutes.

## Deployment models

1. **Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)**
Provides access to networking features, computers and data storage. Provides the highest level of flexibility and managment control over your IT resources.

2. **Platform as a service (PaaS)**
Removes the managment of underlying infrastructure (Hardware and OS). Allows focus on deployment and managment of applications.
No need to worry about procurment, capacity planning, software maintenance and patching.

4. **Software as a service (SaaS)**
Completed software product run bu the service provider. No need to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is mangaged.

## Deployment strategies:
Choice of deplyment depends on unique business needs such as infrastructure, data storage, access requirements. 
1. **Cloud**:
Build new or migrate existing applications to the cloud. Build applications on low-level infrastructure that requires managment or build using higher level services to reduce the manamgnet, architecting and scaling requirements.

3. **Hybrid**:
Cloud based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure. Integrates cloud resources with legacy IT applications. Used when legacy application are maintained on-premise of required by regulations.

5. **On-premises**:
Private cloud deployment using virtualization and resource managment tools. Deployed on premise.
